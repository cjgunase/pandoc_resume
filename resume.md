**Graduate Research Assistant : 2013 - Present**

_Currently Working under [Dr. Hairong Wei](http://www.mtu.edu/forest/about/faculty/wei/) at Michigan Tech. University, conducting research to infer gene regulatory networks and indentify regulatory transcription factors (TFs) which control known biological pathways in *Arabidopsis thaliana* under stress conditions using gene expression data._


* TF-miner is a data analysis pipeline based on partial least squares and graphical gaussian models to identify regulatory TFs using microarray expression under stress conditions. [[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/TF-miner)


* Infer gene regulatory network from DREAM5 dataset and  extend the method for arabidopsis gene expr data  at a Bioinformatics Workshop at Noble Foundation, Ardmore, Oklahoma.[[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/DREAM5_gene_net.git),[[_presentation_]](http://www.slideshare.net/secret/15sqXSMbpOHAOQ)


* Pairwise analysis of gene expression data to find regulatory TF clusters using novel association methods.[[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/MIC_based_gene_expr_analysis)


* Currently implementing a  web based gene expression data analysis pipeline to identify Transcription Factor(TF) clusters which associates with known biological pathways.[[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/TF-Cluster), [[web]](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/cluster/index.php)

_Completed projects_

* Developed an algorithm and web application to search for degenerate motifs in the promoter regions of 50 plant species genomes.[[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/exactSearch), [[web]](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/motif/), [[publication]](http://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-016-0126-6)


* Configured, installed a JBrowse genome browser to visualize RNA-seq and Ribo-seq of wild-type and STTM mutants to parse fastq files.[[web]](https://blossom.ffr.mtu.edu/designindex2.php)


* Collaborated with a lab member to publish an algorithm to infer hierachical gene regulatory network from gene expression data.[[publication]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797117/)


* Collaborated with a lab member  to develop the  Poplar Gene Expression Pipeline web application. [[web]](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu), [[publication]](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11295-014-0745-x#page-1)


* Contributed to the publication of a lab member by creating a Circos Visualization of genomics data from Birch genome.[[source]](https://github.com/cjgunase/myVisualizations/tree/master/circos)

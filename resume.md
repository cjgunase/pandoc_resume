Work Experience & Publications
----------

**Graduate Research Assistant : 2013 - Present**

Currently I am Working under [Dr. Hairong Wei](http://www.mtu.edu/forest/about/faculty/wei/), conducting research to infer gene regulatory networks and indentify regulatory transcription factors (TFs) which control known biological pathways in *Arabidopsis thaliana* under stress conditions using gene expression data. Code and 

* [TF-miner](https://github.com/cjgunase/TF-miner)

* My early [attempts](github repo) for this research was [presented](http://www.slideshare.net/secret/15sqXSMbpOHAOQ) at NSF Project/Bioinformatics Workshop @ Noble Foundation, Ardmore, Oklahoma.


Other projects:

* Currently implementing a [web](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/cluster/index.php) based gene expression data analysis pipeline to identify Transcription Factor(TF) clusters which associates with known biological pathways using novel pair-wise gene association methods such as Maximum Information Coefficient(MIC), Distance Correlation.

* [Developed](https://github.com/cjgunase/exactSearch), [implemented](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/motif/) and [published](http://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-016-0126-6) an algorithm and web application to search for degenerate motifs in the promoter regions of 50 plant species genomes. Our suffix tree based search algorithm can search for 100 degerate motifs in 35000 genes under 4 minutes!.

* [Co-authored](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797117/) an algorithm to infer hierachical gene regulatory network from gene expression data.

* [Implemented](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu) and [Co-authored](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11295-014-0745-x#page-1) Poplar Gene Expression Pipeline web application.

* [Contributor](https://github.com/cjgunase/myVisualizations/tree/master/circos), to Birch Genome publication building a Circos Visualization




**Software Engineer/Research Engineer : 2010 - 2013**

Worked on a [collaborative research project](http://www.vidusayura.org/?page_id=2) with University of Colombo School of Computing and Sri Lanka Navy. Following are the list of publications I authored/contributed:

* Develop algorithms and to implement using Java and web based technologies a Survailance platfrom to fuse data from multiple transponders such as AIS, RADAR sensors around Sri Lanken coast line.[First-Author](http://www.icter.org/conference/icter2012/paper/50)

* Maritime Navigation Simulator Project, [First-Author CGAT 2012, Thailand](http://www.cgames.com.sg/PriorYearsPaper2012.html), Low Cost 3D Immersive Telepresence for Survaillance, Planning, Maneuring : 3D-COP	10.5176/2251-1679_CGAT31. Computer Games, Multimedia & Allied Technology Conference 2012.

* Maritime Navigation Simulator Project, [Co-Author ICter 2012](http://www.icter.org/conference/icter2012/paper/31) for Simulating Narrow Channel Effect on Surge Motion of a Ship in a Virtual Environment

* Undergraduate Research [Conference paper](http://www.icter.org/conference/archive2011/index.php/icter/ICTer2010/paper/view/65), Spatialized Real Time Auditory Interface for a Virtual Maritime Application in 2010.



Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
